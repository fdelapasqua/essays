I have chosen to explore American Impressionist ==Frank Weston Benson=={Q956055} and his use of light and atmosphere in his works. The painting that I specifically chose to look at was After the Storm (1884), which depicts a coastal scene after a storm. The viewer can see that both the sky and sea are calming but there are noticeable effects left over. 	

Benson is renowned for his skillful use of light in his paintings, particularly those of the outdoors. Benson uses light to frame figures and enhance their liveliness and emotion, [A Collection of Benson's Works Demonstrating his Impressionist Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisXUpQ-tfA). His use of atmosphere characterized by a sense of space and of “airiness” conveys both the mood and time of day in the painting. This combination of light and atmosphere invites viewers to experience the serenity and tranquility of nature. These themes are portrayed in Bensons other works such as; Summer and Calm Morning.

This movement embraced a focus on light, atmosphere, and color. A core technique of American Impressionism was the technique of ==En Plein Air=={Q829298}. This was the technique of painting outdoors giving artists the ability to capture capture natural light, shifting colors, and atmospheric effects in real time.

The Met also mentions Benson's technique of  depicting "women and children in tranquil interiors and gardens that ignored or denied the epochal changes taking place beyond their walls."

#Benson and Beyond 
Benson is celebrated for his mastery of light and atmosphere in his Impressionist paintings. Benson captures momentary light and a luminous quality of atmospehere in his works which is very similar to the works of ==Claude Monet=={Q296}, ==John Singer Sargent=={Q155626} and his plein-air works, as well as ==Joaquin Sorolla=={Q351746}.

Sorolla, Monet, and Sargent, like Benson, masterfully employ Impressionist techniques such as nuanced color palettes, expressive brushstrokes, and the dynamic use of light to create intricate and evocative paintings.  Although they all have unique styles that vary due to their cultural background and personal preferences they utilzie their skills to capture the fleeeting moments of everyday life and the beauty of their enviorments. Sorollas vibrant sunlight, Monet's etheral illustrations of nature, Sargents sophisticated subjects, and Bensons serene representations of the New England Coast offer an insight into the visual culture of impressionism and the artists that  inspired Benson's work.
