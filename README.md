I have chosen to explore American Impressionist Frank Weston Benson and his use of light and atmosphere in his works. The painting that I specifically chose to look at was After the Storm (1884), which depicts a coastal scene after a storm. The viewer can see that both the sky and sea are calming but there are noticeable effects left over. 	

Benson is renowned for his skillful use of light in his paintings, particularly those of the outdoors. Benson uses light to frame figures and enhance their liveliness and emotion. His use of atmosphere characterized by a sense of space and of “airiness” conveys both the mood and time of day in the painting. This combination of light and atmosphere invites viewers to experience the serenity and tranquility of nature. These themes are portrayed in Bensons other works such as; Summer and Calm Morning.
