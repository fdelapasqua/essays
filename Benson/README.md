I have chosen to explore American Impressionist Frank Weston Benson and his use of light and atmosphere in his works. The painting that I specifically chose to look at was After the Storm (1884), which depicts a coastal scene after a storm. The viewer can see that both the sky and sea are calming but there are noticeable effects left over. 	

Benson is renowned for his skillful use of light in his paintings, particularly those of the outdoors. Benson uses light to frame figures and enhance their liveliness and emotion. His use of atmosphere characterized by a sense of space and of “airiness” conveys both the mood and time of day in the painting. This combination of light and atmosphere invites viewers to experience the serenity and tranquility of nature. These themes are portrayed in Bensons other works such as; Summer and Calm Morning.

Benson’s son George stands with his back against the sun, and we can almost feel the warmth of the rays cast down, this instills feelings of peace and relaxation.

In the late 1980s Frank Weston Benson began to paint more plen air paintings of the outdoors. Benson mostly painted his family in this idyllic settings and especailly in "Calm Morning" we can see how his use of light and atmosphere play a role in the interpretation of his work. In Calm morning Benson depicts his three older children fishing on small boat. Benson's use of long brushstrokes and color choices give the viewer a feeling of tranquillity. 

#Benson and Beyond 

Benson is celebrated for his mastery of light and atmosphere in his Impressionist paintings. Benson captures momentary light and a luminous quality of atmospehere in his works which is very similar to the works of Claude Monet, John Singer Sargent and his plein-air works, as well as Joaquin Sorolla.
